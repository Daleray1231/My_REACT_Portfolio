# React Portfolio App README

## Overview

The React Portfolio App is designed to showcase a developer's skills and work samples through a single-page application. It aims to provide an interactive and visually appealing portfolio for potential employers to assess the candidate's suitability for open positions.

## User Story

As an employer looking for candidates with experience in building single-page applications, I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples. This will allow me to assess whether they are a good fit for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

The React Portfolio App fulfills the following criteria:

### Header, Content, and Footer:

- The portfolio consists of a header, a section for content, and a footer.

### Navigation:

- The header includes navigation titles for About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume.
- Navigation titles dynamically highlight the current section.
- Users can navigate between sections without page reloading.

### Default Section:

- When loading the portfolio for the first time, the About Me section and title are selected by default.

### About Me Section:

- Displays a recent photo or avatar of the developer.
- Includes a short bio about the developer.

### Portfolio Section:

- Showcases titled images of six applications.
- Provides links to both the deployed applications and corresponding GitHub repositories.

### Contact Section:

- Features a contact form with fields for name, email address, and a message.
- Notifies users if a required field is left empty.
- Notifies users if an invalid email address is entered.

### Resume Section:

- Includes a link to a downloadable resume.
- Lists the developer's proficiencies.

### Footer:

- Presents text or icon links to the developerâ€™s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
- Includes a link to the developer's profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter).
